# Data-Analysis-Project-R-Horror-Movies
In our project, We will focus on two main questions:

Is the expectancy of Horror Movie ratings in the USA is equal to the expectancy of Horror Movie ratings every where else. In order to check the difference between the expected values we will check if the variances of the two are equal to each other.

Find the Linear Regression and Correlation between the year the movie was released in and it’s budget. (axes x - year of release, axes y - movie’s budget).
